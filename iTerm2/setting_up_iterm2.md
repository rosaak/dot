##  iTerm2

- install iter2 with brew

```bash
brew install iter2

```

### For Shell Integration

- go to iTerm2 >> Install Shell Integration
- then try `alias` to see which new aliases are available with the shell integration
- `imgls` requires php which can be installed via brew 
- after installing these commands are on your disposal 

```raw
  imgcat filename                     #  Displays the image inline.
  imgls                               #  Shows a directory listing with image thumbnails.
  it2api                              # Command-line utility to manipulate iTerm2.
  it2attention start|stop|fireworks   # Gets your attention.
  it2check                            # Checks if the terminal is iTerm2.
  it2copy [filename]                  # Copies to the pasteboard.
  it2dl filename                      # Downloads the specified file, saving it in your Downloads folder.
  it2setcolor ...                     #  Changes individual color settings or loads a color preset.
  it2setkeylabel ...                  # Changes Touch Bar function key labels.
  it2ul                               # Uploads a file.
  it2universion                       # Sets the current unicode version.
```

- customizing iTerm2 involves customizing the colorshema, fonts and themes
- I am going with the color pallet of `Oceanic-Next `and  `Hack Nerd Font Mono`
