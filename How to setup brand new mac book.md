## iTerm2

- customizing iTerm2 involves customizing the colorshema , fonts and themes
- I am going with the color pallet of `Oceanic-Next `and  `Hack Nerd Font Mono`

wget -O ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/cobalt2.zsh-theme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm/master/cobalt2.zsh-theme
```
- also add this `ZSH_THEME=cobalt2` to the `.zshrc` file

- get color themes
```
cd Downloads
wget -O cobalt2.itermcolors https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm/master/cobalt2.itermcolors
wget -O Oceanic-Dark-iterm3.itermcolors  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhartington/oceanic-next-iterm/master/Oceanic-Dark-iterm3.itermcolors
wget -O Oceanic-Next.itermcolors https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhartington/oceanic-next-iterm/master/Oceanic-Next.itermcolors
