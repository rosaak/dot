## iTerm2

- `brew install iter2` has been run earlier
### start from iterm2 Install Shell Integration 
- go to iTerm2  >> Install Shell Integration
- then try `alias` to see which new aliases are available with the shell integration
- `imgls` requires php which can be installed via brew 
- after installing these commands are on your disposal 
```
imgcat filename                     #  Displays the image inline.
imgls                               #  Shows a directory listing with image thumbnails.
it2api                              # Command-line utility to manipulate iTerm2.
it2attention start|stop|fireworks   # Gets your attention.
it2check                            # Checks if the terminal is iTerm2.
it2copy [filename]                  # Copies to the pasteboard.
it2dl filename                      # Downloads the specified file, saving it in your Downloads folder.
it2setcolor ...                     #  Changes individual color settings or loads a color preset.
it2setkeylabel ...                  # Changes Touch Bar function key labels.
it2ul                               # Uploads a file.
it2universion                       # Sets the current unicode version.
```
- customizing iTerm2 involves customizing the colorshema , fonts and themes
- I am going with the color pallet of `Oceanic-Next `and  `Hack Nerd Font Mono`

### Color Schema 
#### Color Schema - Cobalt
- https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm
- download it into the oh-my-zsh themes dir

```
wget -O ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/cobalt2.zsh-theme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm/master/cobalt2.zsh-theme
```

- also add this `ZSH_THEME=cobalt2` to the `.zshrc` file
- get color themes

```
cd Downloads
wget -O cobalt2.itermcolors https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm/master/cobalt2.itermcolors
wget -O Oceanic-Dark-iterm3.itermcolors  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhartington/oceanic-next-iterm/master/Oceanic-Dark-iterm3.itermcolors
wget -O Oceanic-Next.itermcolors https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhartington/oceanic-next-iterm/master/Oceanic-Next.itermcolors
```
- open `iTerm2 >> Profile >> EditProfile` and add a new Profile with int he `Colors` tab
